    /**
     * Note that there can be several Changelogs inside a directory tree.
     * The {@link ChangeLogWriter#writeChangeLog()} code assumes that the full path to
     * the ChangeLog file and the full path to the file for which to generate a ChangeLog
     * entry have the same ancestor (with some potential overlap).
     *
     * Consider the following example:
     *
     * 1. The ChangeLog file is <project-root>/src/ChangeLog
     * 2. The currently open editor contains code of <project-root>/src/org/eclipse/example/Test.java
     *
     * In the above case entries in <project-root>/src/ChangeLog *should* be of the form:
     *
     * <code>
     *
     * YYYY-MM-DD  Author Name  <email@example.com>
     *
     *    * org/eclipse/example/Test.java: new File
     *
     * </code>
     *
     * Similarly, if the ChangeLog file is in <project-root>/ChangeLog and the currently open
     * file is <project-root>/src/org/eclipse/example/Sun.java, generated entries in
     * <project-root>/ChangeLog would look like (note the "src" path is added in this case):
     *
     * <code>
     *
     * YYYY-MM-DD  Author Name  <email@example.com>
     *
     *    * src/org/eclipse/example/Sun.java: new File
     *
     * </code>
     *
     * Test for method {@link org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.changelog.core.ChangeLogWriter#writeChangeLog()}
